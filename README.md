### About

I am a Computer Science student focused on building reliable software systems.

My interests sit at the intersection of:
- Systems programming and operating systems
- Backend architecture and distributed systems
- Applied AI in real-world products

I care about performance, clean architecture, and building software that scales beyond demos.
